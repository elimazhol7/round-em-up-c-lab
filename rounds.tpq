1.No, the spacing between numbers generally does not matter when reading data from
a file if especially if I'm using standard input operators (like >>). The operator automatically 
skips whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newlines, between numbers. 
2. No, the integers do not have to be in any specific order for most calculations, like finding the sum,
average, maximum, or minimum. If a program requires a sorted list for later processing,
then the order matters, but for basic calculations, order is irrelevant.
3. No, the program handles both integers and floating-point numbers. Using double or 
float as the data type is a good choice, it allows for decimal numbers. 
4.No, it is not possible under normal circumstances. The program reads numbers one at a time and only 
keeps a few variables in memory (count, mean, M2, min, max). It does not store
the entire dataset in memory, so memory usage is constant and independent of file size.
5. I need to adjust the largest and smallest values to the first number read from the file, so
my comparisons are valid.
